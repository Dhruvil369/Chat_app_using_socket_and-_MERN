Real-Time Chat Application

This project is a real-time chat application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) and Socket.IO for real-time communication. The application allows users to engage in one-to-one chats with real-time updates and efficient communication. It integrates several libraries for state management, notifications, and seamless UI/UX.
